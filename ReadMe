This repo contains the two following files:

1.) run_analysis.R - R scrip to perform the analysis as outlined in the assignment page:
        -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2.) CodeBook.md - document that describes the variables, data, and transformations

The file "Final.txt" is the output given from the script detailed in 1.)
